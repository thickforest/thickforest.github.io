<p nodeIndex="12">The <b nodeIndex="133">Ne2000 network card chipset</b> was a reference design that was never meant to go into mainstream production, but after Novell used it as cheap hardware to go with their software it became popular. It is a good first network card to program because it follows a simple design (making it helpful for learning), they're probably dirt-cheap, and it is supported by most PC emulators. Both <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Bochs" title="Bochs" nodeIndex="134">Bochs</a> and <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/QEMU" title="QEMU" nodeIndex="135">QEMU</a> provide ISA and PCI implementations.</p>
<p nodeIndex="13">Ne2000 is not technically a card, it is a standard that several implementors follow. The best available description of the initial standard was located <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.national.com/pf/DP/DP8390D.html" nodeIndex="136">DP8390D/NS32490D NIC Network Interface Controller</a> and was published by National Semiconductor.</p>
<h2 nodeIndex="33"><span class="mw-headline" id="Quick_Overview_of_the_NIC_design" nodeIndex="138">Quick Overview of the NIC design</span></h2>
<p nodeIndex="34">The Ne2000 network card uses two <i nodeIndex="139">ring buffers</i> for packet handling. These are circular buffers made of 256-byte <i nodeIndex="140">pages</i> that the chip's <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/DMA" title="DMA" class="mw-redirect" nodeIndex="141">DMA</a> logic will use to store received packets or to get received packets.</p>
<p nodeIndex="35">Note that a packet will <i nodeIndex="142">always</i> start on a page boundary, thus there may be unused bytes at the end of a page.</p>
<h4 nodeIndex="143"><span class="mw-headline" id="Ring_Buffer" nodeIndex="144">Ring Buffer</span></h4>
<p nodeIndex="36">Two registers <tt nodeIndex="145">PSTART</tt> and <tt nodeIndex="146">PSTOP</tt> define a set of 256-byte pages in the <i nodeIndex="147">buffer memory</i> that will be used for the ring buffer. As soon as the DMA attempts to read/write to <tt nodeIndex="148">PSTOP</tt>, it will be sent back to <tt nodeIndex="149">PSTART</tt></p>
<pre nodeIndex="37">
PSTART                                                                       PSTOP

####| Packet 3 (cont) |########|########|Packet1#|   Packet  2#####|Packet 3|####
####+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+####

An 8-page ring buffer with 3 packets and 2 free slots.
</pre>
<p nodeIndex="38">While receiving, the NIC has 2 additional registers that point to the first packet that's still to be read and to the start of the currently written packet (named <i nodeIndex="150">boundary pointer</i> and <i nodeIndex="151">current page</i> respectively).</p>
<h3 nodeIndex="39"><span class="mw-headline" id="Register_Pages" nodeIndex="152">Register Pages</span></h3>
<p nodeIndex="40">Programming registers of the NE2000 are collected in <i nodeIndex="153">pages</i>. Page 0 contains most of the <i nodeIndex="154">control and status</i> registers while page 1 contains physical (PAR0..PAR5) and multicast addresses (MAR0..MAR7) to be checked by the card.</p>
<p nodeIndex="41">Note that the same register number could have a different meaning depending whether you <i nodeIndex="155">read</i> or <i nodeIndex="156">write</i> to it. For instance, register 0x0C on page 0 is the <i nodeIndex="157">receive configuration register</i> in <i nodeIndex="158">write</i> mode and "receive status register" in <i nodeIndex="159">read</i> mode. Most of the <i nodeIndex="160">configuration</i> registers can still be read on page 2 though. Each register is a single byte and the page is selected by highest 2 bits of the COMMAND register (which is available in all pages)</p>

<p nodeIndex="44">This wasn't exactly obvious, but by looking at the <i nodeIndex="162">ne2k-pci</i> module from Linux I managed to figure out how to initilize the card and read its MAC address:</p>

outb(nif->iobase + 0x0A, 0);         // clear the count regs
outb(nif->iobase + 0x0B, 0);
outb(nif->iobase + 0x0F, 0);         // mask completion IRQ
outb(nif->iobase + 0x07, 0xFF);

outb(nif->iobase + 0x0D, 0x02);              // and loopback mode.
outb(nif->iobase + 0x0A, 32);                // reading 32 bytes
outb(nif->iobase + 0x0B, 0);         // count high
outb(nif->iobase + 0x08, 0);         // start DMA at 0
outb(nif->iobase + 0x09, 0);         // start DMA high
outb(nif->iobase, 0x0A);             // start the read

int i;
for (i=0; i<32; i++)
{
  prom[i] = inb(nif->iobase + 0x10);
};

// program the PAR0..PAR5 registers to listen for packets to our MAC address!
