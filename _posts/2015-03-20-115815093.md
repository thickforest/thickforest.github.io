<h3 nodeIndex="19">RIP-relative addressing</h3>
<p nodeIndex="20">On x86, while function references (with the <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="118">call</tt> instruction) use relative offsets from the instruction pointer, data references (with the <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="119">mov</tt> instruction) only support absolute addresses. As we've seen in the previous article, this makes PIC code somewhat less efficient, since PIC by its nature requires making all offsets IP-relative; absolute addresses and position independence don't go well together.</p>
<p nodeIndex="21">x64 fixes that, with a new "RIP-relative addressing mode", which is the default for all 64-bit <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="120">mov</tt> instructions that reference memory (it's used for other instructions as well, such as <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="121">lea</tt>). A quote from the "Intel Architecture Manual vol 2a":</p>
<blockquote nodeIndex="22">A new addressing form, RIP-relative (relative instruction-pointer) addressing, is implemented in 64-bit mode. An effective address is formed by adding displacement to the 64-bit RIP of the next instruction.</blockquote>
<p nodeIndex="23">The displacement used in RIP-relative mode is 32 bits in size. Since it should be useful for both positive and negative offsets, roughly +/- 2GB is the maximal offset from RIP supported by this addressing mode.</p>

<p nodeIndex="29">Let's look at the disassembly of <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="129">ml_func</tt>:</p>

<p nodeIndex="32">The most interesting instruction here is at <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="130">0x5f6</tt>: it places the address of <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="131">myglobal</tt> into <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="132">rax</tt>, by referencing an entry in the GOT. As we can see, it uses RIP relative addressing. Since it's relative to the address of the next instruction, what we actually get is <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="133">0x5fd + 0x2009db = 0x200fd8</tt>. So the GOT entry holding the address of <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="134">myglob</tt> is at <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="135">0x200fd8</tt>. Let's check if it makes sense:</p>

<p nodeIndex="35">GOT starts at <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="136">0x200fc8</tt>, so <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="137">myglob</tt> is in its third entry.

<p nodeIndex="42">Now let's see how function calls work with PIC code on x64. Once again, we'll use the same example from the previous article:</p>

}
</pre></div>
<p nodeIndex="45">Disassembling <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="159">ml_func</tt>, we get:</p>
<div class="highlight" nodeIndex="46">
<pre nodeIndex="47">
000000000000064b <ml_func>:

<p nodeIndex="48">The call is, as before, to <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="160">ml_util_func@plt</tt>. Let's see what's there:</p>

<p nodeIndex="51">So, the GOT entry holding the actual address of <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="161">ml_util_func</tt> is at <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="162">0x200aa2 + 0x566 = 0x201008</tt>.</p>
<p nodeIndex="52">And there's a relocation for it, as expected:</p>

<h3 nodeIndex="56">Performance implications</h3>
<p nodeIndex="57">In both examples, it can be seen that PIC on x64 requires less instructions than on x86. On x86, the GOT address is loaded into some base register (<tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="163">ebx</tt> by convention) in two steps - first the address of the instruction is obtained with a special function call, and then the offset to GOT is added. Both steps aren't required on x64, since the relative offset to GOT is known to the linker and can simply be encoded in the instruction itself with RIP relative addressing.</p>
<p nodeIndex="58">When calling a function, there's also no need to prepare the GOT address in <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="164">ebx</tt> for the trampoline, as the x86 code does, since the trampoline just accesses its GOT entry directly through RIP-relative addressing.</p>
<p nodeIndex="59">So PIC on x64 still requires extra instructions when compared to non-PIC code, but the additional cost is smaller. The indirect cost of tying down a register to use as the GOT pointer (which is painful on x86) is also gone, since no such register is needed with RIP-relative addressing <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/11/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries-on-x64#id10" id="id3" nodeIndex="165">[3]</a>. All in all, x64 PIC results in a much smaller performance hit than on x86, making it much more attractive. So attractive, in fact, that it's the default method for writing shared libraries for this architecture.</p>

<p nodeIndex="62">Not only does <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="166">gcc</tt> encourage you to use PIC for shared libraries on x64, it requires it by default.

<p nodeIndex="71">Here is the <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="177">R_X86_64_PC32</tt> relocation the linker was complaining about. It just can't link an object with such relocation into a shared library. Why? Because the displacement of the <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="178">mov</tt> (the part that's added to <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="179">rip</tt>) must fit in 32 bits, and when a code gets into a shared library, we just can't know in advance that 32 bits will be enough. After all, this is a full 64-bit architecture, with a vast address space. The symbol may eventually be found in some shared library that's farther away from the reference than 32 bits will allow to reference. This makes <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="180">R_X86_64_PC32</tt> an invalid relocation for shared libraries on x64.</p>
<p nodeIndex="72">But can we still somehow create non-PIC code on x64? Yes! We should be instructing the compiler to use the "large code model", by adding the <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="181"><span class="pre" nodeIndex="182">-mcmodel=large</span></tt> flag. The topic of code models is interesting, but explaining it would just take us too far from the real goal of this article <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/11/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries-on-x64#id13" id="id6" nodeIndex="183">[6]</a>. So I'll just say briefly that a code model is a kind of agreement between the programmer and the compiler, where the programmer makes a certain promise to the compiler about the size of offsets the program will be using. In exchange, the compiler can generate better code.</p>
<p nodeIndex="73">It turns out that to make the compiler generate non-PIC code on x64 that actually pleases the linker, only the large code model is suitable, because it's the least restrictive. Remember how I explained why the simple relocation isn't good enough on x64, for fear of an offset which will get farther than 32 bits away during linking? Well, the large code model basically gives up on all offset assumptions and uses the largest 64-bit offsets for all its data references. This makes load-time relocations always safe, and enables non-PIC code generation on x64. Let's see the disassembly of the first example compiled without <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="184"><span class="pre" nodeIndex="185">-fpic</span></tt> and with <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="186"><span class="pre" nodeIndex="187">-mcmodel=large</span></tt>:</p>

<p nodeIndex="81">Some judgmental thinking may bring you to ponder why the compiler generated code that isn't suitable for load-time relocation by default. The answer to this is simple. Don't forget that code also tends to get directly linked into executables, which don't require load-time relocations at all. Therefore, by default the compiler assumes the small code model to generate the most efficient code. If you know your code is going to get into a shared library, and you don't want PIC, then just tell it to use the large code model explicitly. I think <tt class="docutils literal" nodeIndex="196">gcc</tt>'s behavior makes sense here.</p>
<p nodeIndex="82">Another thing to think about is why there are no problems with PIC code using the small code model. The reason is that the GOT is always located in the same shared library as the code that references it, and unless a single shared library is big enough for a 32-bit address space, there should be no problems addressing the PIC with 32-bit RIP-relative offsets. Such huge shared libraries are unlikely, but in case you're working on one, the AMD64 ABI has a "large PIC code model" for this purpose.</p>
